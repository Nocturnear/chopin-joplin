To try it out, run the main method in the CJComposer class, which can be found in the driver package.
This will generate a MIDI file called chopin-joplin.mid in "lib/generated/".
To see samples made with different degree n-grams, check out [3/4/5/6]Grams.mid, which are also in "lib/generated/".

Module 1: Joplin Harmonies
- Create recombinant generative model for Joplin harmonies
	+ Include logic to recognize beginning patterns to facilitate grouping piece into measures
	+ Recognize harmony pattern candidates by looking for repetitions in pieces
	+ Decide on key signature, tempo, number of movements, dominant key, and subdominant key of composition
	
	+ Generate harmonies for the composition
	+ Have a dominant theme that is in the dominant key signature and repeats throughout the piece
	+ The other themes are in the subdominant key and are unique
		
Module 2: Chopin Melodies	
- Create n-gram based generative model for melodies
	+ Scrape the Chopin piece for all of the n-grams (The degree of the n-gram can be changed using Utils.GRAM_LENGTH)
	+ Construct a tree structure for all of the n-grams
	+ Generate melodies using the n-grams
		- Ensure a similar structure of dominant and subdominant themes, as with the harmony

Module 3: Integration
- Combine the melody and harmony into final composition
